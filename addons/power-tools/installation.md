That means that you need to activate license key or you won't get updates and you always will see that warning. It will disappear when you will put license key for your product in Add-on tab where the link should take you. 

### Adding License Keys

On the Licenses admin screen, you should see all your installed products, with an option to add your license key for product.

To **add a license key**:

*   **copy** the license key from your [UD Account](https://usabilitydynamics.com/account) page or receipt email.

*   **paste** the license key into input field for your product.
*   **save** settings to **activate** your product.

### Updating your product

Once you have activated your product, you’ll be able to update your product via the **Dashboard > Updates** admin screen.

To update your product:

1.  Go to **Dashboard > Updates**
2.  **Select** your product under Plugins/Themes
3.  Click the **update** button

When updating plugins and themes, your files **will be overwritten**. We recommend [backing up your files](http://codex.wordpress.org/Backing_Up_Your_WordPress_Files), and using [child themes](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes) for modifications.

### Terms of use 

Products do not have the limit of usage. License gives you the ability to update add-on or theme** within one year after download.** You will still have the ability to use a product after one year expired, but updates won’t be available anymore. To receive updates after one year expired you will need to redownload the product. 


### Customization

Please also note that we do not support our products if the code was customized directly. After update **you will lose your plugin customization**. If you need to customize some template in our plugin,</span> you will need to copy the template to the root theme/child theme folder and only there customize it.

### Moving licenses

Each add-on you can use on two sites. So if you need to test between staging and production it’s simple. You can also easily move licenses from site to site. To deactivate your license key and reactivate it for another site please go to your Account Dashboard > [UD Account](https://usabilitydynamics.com/account) page.

From here you can ‘deactivate’ your license key:

Then you can reactivate the same license by going to your other WordPress site’s Dashboard where it says WP-Property Licenses, and copy and paste your license and hit enter. Follow the steps above for Adding Licenses if needed.
