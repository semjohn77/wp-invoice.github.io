### Welcome to the WP-Invoice: Electronic Signature wiki!

### Provide your client an ability to sign invoices prior to payment

Imaging you can get a signature from a client who pays your invoices: you ask for a full name and to write a signature before clicking `Pay` button. This Add-on makes your imagination come true.

Payers sign invoices directly in a browser by drawing a signature with their mouses or finger (if on mobile or tablet). After payment signature appears on invoice receipt page and on edit invoice page as well in a specific metabox.

### Get started

Once plugin is installed and activated you'll notice the new option in Payment settings of each invoice (Not for manual Payments):

Clients will see the following inputs for a signature. It is required to fill Name and draw a signature otherwise payment will be declined.
