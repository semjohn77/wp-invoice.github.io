#Here are the instructions for translating add-ons:

1. Download [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) to your PC. 
2. Before translating, please make sure to click on the "Update" button in Poedit, so you have the latest string of the add-on.
3. Translate the file which is located in "plug-in name"/static/language folder. 
4. Name the translated file accordingly: wp-invoice-spc-dk_DK.po  (if this is for wp-invoice-spc for dutch translation). Make sure that the abbreviations are correct.
5. Go into the file and save it again, this will automatically create a "mo" file with the same name.

##Important:  
Each translated file should be located in the correct location.
###Example: 
If this is WP-Invoice the file should be in  wp-invoice/static/languages and if it is for wp-invoice-spc the file should be wp-invoice-spc/static/languages.
