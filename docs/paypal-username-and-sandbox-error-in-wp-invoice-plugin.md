Before posting topics regarding PP errors with Sandbox please be sure that you use correct PayPal Username. It is your PayPal ID or an email address associated with your PayPal account. Email addresses must be confirmed.

Also, you must know that every specific invoice has its own payment settings. These settings are more important than global plugin settings.
