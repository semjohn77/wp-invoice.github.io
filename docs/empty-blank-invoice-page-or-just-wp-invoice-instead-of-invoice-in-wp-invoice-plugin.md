First of all check following things:

* Try to use "Turn off compatibility mode." option in Settings/Main tab.  

* Disable third-party plugins one by one to be sure that the issue is not related to any of them.

* Try to switch theme to WordPress default(TwentyTwelve) to be sure that the issue is not related to the current theme.

* And contact your host provider. It can be that they do not allow get parameters to be paste.
